# Dofus Craftlist

Small craft list (shopping list) generator for crafting Dofus items. Made with React using Hooks and a public API.

## How to use

You can start using it by entering any item name, or general MMO-related word, for example "Shield" or "Helmet", it will then return a nice list that you can use in order to buy all the required items for your crafts.

## Future plans

- Making a consumable section
- Export to .csv / .xls
- Able to save specific lists


### Personal plans
- Button to clear shopping list
- Checkbox on each resource to indicate that you have enough
- Try to group resources by word radical to make easier to buy search and buy similar resources (e.g. search spimush to buy red, brown, green and blue spimush), could be very hard, maybe AI would reaonably solve this?
